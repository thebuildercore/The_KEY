## ❓ Problem

Billions are allocated to government schemes, but:
- 🕳️ Lack of transparency leads to corruption.
- 🧾 No public tracking of fund flow.
- 🔁 Status updates are unreliable or falsified.
- 👥 Citizens can't report issues effectively.
- 👥 Unnecessary project delays by the officials.
- 👥 Exploitation of unserved population of the nation prevent them from bribes.

## ✅ Solution

**Government Scheme Tracker** uses **blockchain + web tech** to:
- Register/Mint each scheme on-chain with a **unique wallet address**.
- Track scheme **progress** and **milestones** via smart contracts.
- Allow **citizen feedback** (off-chain, linked to scheme ID).
- Create a **public dashboard** with verified updates.
